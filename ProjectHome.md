## Quake Construct ##

Quake Construct is a quake3 mod that allows anyone with at least some knowledge of the lua programming language to create simple small modifications for the Quake 3 engine.

Through the use of hooks and bindings to the quake3 engine, users can assign their own responses to particular events that happen in-game.

Lua is a high-level programming language, usually used for providing scripting access for lower-level code. (see http://www.lua.org/pil/)
